<p>Recently at work I have been tasked with helping our organization transition
from our traditional on-premises infrastructure to Azure. To do that, I&rsquo;ve been
learning how to automate our infrastructure by using HashiCorp&rsquo;s
<a href="terraform.io">Terraform</a>. Terraform was introduced to me by a few members of
our infrastructure team and I&rsquo;ve found it quite fun to work with.</p>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve been working on what direction we&rsquo;d like to head, I&rsquo;ve focused on new
apps using Platform as a Service, specifically Azure Web Apps. A few months back
I noticed that Web Apps had a new option for using Docker containers, so about a
week ago I decided to see if I could create an Azure Web App for Containers
using Terraform.</p>

<p>It turns out, this is already possible but it took some fiddling to figure out
what I needed to set up in Terraform. I assume this isn&rsquo;t very well documented
yet because Azure Web App for Containers only recently went
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/general-availability-of-app-service-on-linux-and-web-app-for-containers/">GA</a>.
So to make sure I remember how to do this, and if anyone else could use this,
I&rsquo;m writing this down here.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-container-registry">Creating the Container Registry</h2>

<p>You first have to have the container registry created before you create the App
Service. Creating the container registry is no different than what is described
in the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/container_registry.html">azurem provider
documentation</a>.
The main thing to note is that from the tests I was running, I needed to have
the container registry created well before I created the App Service Plan and
App Service. Otherwise it seemed that the Azure Web App didn&rsquo;t recognize the
container registry.</p>

<p>The example documentation does use the <code>Classic</code> SKU, I went ahead and changed
that to use <code>Basic</code>. If you do that, you do not need to create a separate
Storage Account. I chose to do this because the Azure Portal suggested upgrading
from Classic to Basic.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-app-service-plan">Creating the App Service Plan</h2>

<p>The App Service plan is close to the same as the
<a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/app_service_plan.html">documentation</a>.
The main thing to make sure you set is the fact that it is a Linux plan.</p>

<span class="ln"> 9</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="ln">10</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I also put this as a reserved instance, but I&rsquo;m not 100% sure that is needed.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-app-service">Creating the App Service</h2>

<p>This was the trickiest part. Not only do you have to set some <code>site_config</code>
properties. You also have to set a few app settings as well.</p>

<p>Here is what the Terraform config looks like to get this set up right.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="ln"> 1</span><span class="n">resource</span> <span class="s">&#34;azurerm_app_service&#34;</span> <span class="s">&#34;containertest&#34;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="ln"> 6</span>
<span class="ln"> 7</span>  <span class="n">site_config</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="ln"> 8</span>    <span class="n">always_on</span>        <span class="p">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span>

<span class="ln">10</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="ln">11</span>
<span class="ln">12</span>  <span class="n">app_settings</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="ln">13</span>    <span class="s">&#34;WEBSITES_ENABLE_APP_SERVICE_STORAGE&#34;</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#34;false&#34;</span>
<span class="ln">14</span>    <span class="s">&#34;DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL&#34;</span>          <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#34;https://${data.azurerm_container_registry.containertest.login_server}&#34;</span>
<span class="ln">15</span>    <span class="s">&#34;DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_USERNAME&#34;</span>     <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#34;${data.azurerm_container_registry.containertest.admin_username}&#34;</span>
<span class="ln">16</span>    <span class="s">&#34;DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_PASSWORD&#34;</span>     <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">&#34;${data.azurerm_container_registry.containertest.admin_password}&#34;</span>
<span class="ln">17</span>  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="ln">18</span><span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The big part here to notice is the <code>linux_fx_version</code> under <code>site_config</code>. The
documentation in the azurerm provider isn&rsquo;t super clear how this works. The
example uses <code>DOCKER|(golang:latest)</code>. What it doesn&rsquo;t show or explain is that
string uses Dockerhub. If you want to use a different registry the format looks
like this <code>DOCKER|&lt;registryurl&gt;/&lt;container&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Under <code>app_settings</code> I had to create an app service from the Azure portal and
poke around the settings to reverse engineer what I needed in my terraform
config. Not only do you need the <code>linux_fx_version</code> property that has the
registry URL, you also have to set that as an app setting. Once that happens,
you need a username and password to access the registry. Fortunately Terraform
exposes all of this information so you can reference the properties as data.</p>

<p>This should get you up and running with a Web App for Container. This took a few
hours of my weekend to get running. Hopefully this can help others get up and
running more quickly. I&rsquo;ll eventually come back to this and try getting this
down to the smallest set possible as there are a few items I&rsquo;m not 100% sure I
actually need. If I get a smaller setup, I&rsquo;ll update the post with that
information.</p>
