<p>I&rsquo;ve never paid much attention to podcasts. Up until a few months ago I was
commuting to work by train and used that time to either read books, or play
games. All of that has been great and I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the time I have had to read,
relax, or learn something new. Recently, I&rsquo;ve had to begin commuting to work
which completely threw the routine I had developed.</p>

<p>Since I can&rsquo;t really read or play games commuting, I had to find another
alternative. I remembered my iPhone has a Podcasting app built in so I decided
to dive in. After a bit of Googling, I came across <a href="http://developeronfire.com/">Developer on
Fire</a> and decided to give it a spin. The very first
episode I listened to was with <a href="http://developeronfire.com/episode-054-woody-zuill-turn-up-the-good">Woody
Zuill</a>. By
the time I had pulled into the parking lot, I had an idea I had learned from the
podcast I wanted to share with my team.</p>

<p>That experience hooked me on how useful a Podcast can be. I spend so much time
commuting each day and I don&rsquo;t want to be wasting that time only driving. Since
then I&rsquo;ve been searching for a range of podcasts to listen to. Here are the
podcasts I&rsquo;m currently listening to.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.dotnetrocks.com/">.NET Rocks!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/anotherround">Another Round</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbie</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developeronfire.com/">Developer On Fire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developertea.com/">Developer Tea</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.edityourlifeshow.com/">Edit Your Life</a></li>
<li><a href="http://hanselminutes.com/">Hanselminutes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.newrustacean.com/">New Rustacean</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thepsychologypodcast.com/">The Psychology Podcast</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developers Life</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="not-just-development-podcasts">Not Just Development Podcasts</h2>

<p>At first, I was just listening to Developer on Fire and Developer Tea but it has
been great to expand that list with a few podcasts on other topics I&rsquo;m
interested in. For example, The Psychology Podcast with Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman
is a great podcast that focuses on a range of topics in psychology. Some great
episodes have been on understanding and supporting people with ADHD and learning
about the concept of Grit.</p>

<p>Edit Your Life is also a great podcast about simplifying and decluttering your
life. Hosts Asha Dornfest and Christine Koh have episodes on varying topics from
parenting, personal finances and general relationship tips. I&rsquo;ve found their
episodes to be fun and very informative.</p>

<p>Really branching out and listening to more than just podcasts has been a really
great and informative time. I&rsquo;ll wrap this up now, but if you have any podcasts
you enjoy, please let me know on Twitter!</p>
