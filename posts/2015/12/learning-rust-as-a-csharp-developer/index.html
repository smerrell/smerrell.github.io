<p>Choosing a new programming language to learn is difficult. What do I want to
focus on? Do I want to learn something low level like C? Do I want to go all out
functional and learn Haskell? What about Go? Everyone seems to be glowing about
that language. Elixir? I hear Rubyists are really digging on that language, and
it is built on top of Erlang! So many choices!</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;ve probably guessed from the title, I ended up picking the <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust
programming language</a> as the language I&rsquo;d like to focus
on and learn about. So lets take a little bit of time to talk about why I made
that choice.</p>

<h2 id="a-way-to-delve-into-systems-programming">A way to delve into &ldquo;systems programming&rdquo;</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Systems programming&rdquo; feels like this mythical place of expert developers
writing bare metal code to do things I can barely even understad. It is so
different from my day-to-day job that it feels almost unattainable. I&rsquo;ve never
written anything in assembly, I can&rsquo;t really read hex, and I&rsquo;ve only barely
tried to write anything in C. It really feels like such a daunting task to get
into what seems like such a complicated topic.</p>

<p>Fortunatly, Rust really feels like an accessible language that could get me
learning about systems programming. I can learn how to manage my own memory, how
to write performant code, how to work safely with pointers and many other &ldquo;low
level&rdquo; bits of code. For whatever reason, Rust just feels like I can jump in and
actually do something. I haven&rsquo;t felt that way with C or C++.</p>

<h2 id="a-c-replacement">A C replacement</h2>

<p>I swear, one day I actually am going to get around to learning C. When I do I&rsquo;m
going to do it <a href="http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/">the hard way</a>. But until
I do, one of the reasons I picked Rust is that it is explicitly aimed at
replacing C and C++ as the programming language of choice for prople writing
performance critical or low level code. I&rsquo;ve started and quickly stopped
learning C and I haven&rsquo;t found the motivation yet to stick with it and really
learn the language. I&rsquo;m sure I will eventually, but I think the barrier to entry
has still been too high for me.</p>

<p>With Rust, I have been able to get going pretty quickly in the language and
start to learn bits and pieces about Rust while doing interesting things. I&rsquo;m
sure I could also do this with C, but so far I just haven&rsquo;t had the willpower to
stick with it. Rust, on the other hand, has kept me very interested and very
motivated to learn the language.</p>

<h2 id="no-gc">No GC</h2>

<p>Another specific reason I chose Rust was that I wanted to try out a language
that does no garbage collection for me. Throughout my career as a developer I&rsquo;ve
worked in a garbage collected language, and honestly it is pretty awesome most
of the time. But, since it is the only thing I&rsquo;ve used before and I want to
learn lower level programming skills, I have to learn how to walk away from
garbage collection and learn how to manage memory myself.</p>

<h2 id="modern-language-features">Modern language features</h2>

<p>As a final deciding factor, the language features that Rust provides are very
compelling to me. Generics are available and I am familiar with how to use them
in C#, Traits (i.e. Interfaces for C# people), pattern matching, etc. are all
language features that feel very compelling and interesting to use.</p>

<p>So there you have it, a few of the reasons that I&rsquo;ve decided to spend time
really trying to dig in and learn the Rust programming language. I have much to
learn and will likely be sporadically sharing what I&rsquo;ve come across so far here
on this blog.</p>
