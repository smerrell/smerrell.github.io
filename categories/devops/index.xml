      <description>Building software has always been a hassle. Over the years, the effort it takes to create a reliable build system has decreased drastically. Tools like Travis CI dramatically reduce the time and effort it takes to go from nothing to a functioning continuous integration pipeline. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few CI tools like Travis, AppVeyor, and TeamCity. One CI application I had not tried, was Visual Studio Team Services â€” better known as VSTS.</description>

      <description>Recently at work I have been tasked with helping our organization transition from our traditional on-premises infrastructure to Azure. To do that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning how to automate our infrastructure by using HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform. Terraform was introduced to me by a few members of our infrastructure team and I&amp;rsquo;ve found it quite fun to work with.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on what direction we&amp;rsquo;d like to head, I&amp;rsquo;ve focused on new apps using Platform as a Service, specifically Azure Web Apps.</description>
