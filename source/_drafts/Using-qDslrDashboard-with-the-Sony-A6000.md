So usually most of my posts are going to be something technology related but I
_do_ happen to have other interests. For a while now, I've had a Sony a6000 that
I've been very happy with. I'm very much an amateur at photography but I find it
fun and I like the images I get of my family more than the ones I can get from
my iPhone.

This Christmas, I finally got a tripod and it has gotten me interested in trying
to do some timelapse photography. Sony has a timelapse app but I wanted to see
what other options were out there. After a bit of Googling, I came across
[DslrDashboard](http://dslrdashboard.info).


Make sure to have the Sony up to date with the latest remote app, you have to
have a plastation netowrk account... Sigh

Once you install it, go into apps and then start the remote app

Connect your device to the Wifi network created by the phone

Once you do that, you can tap the sony button. The first time I tried, I had to
tap it a couple times and then it finally connected. At first I had though I had
wasted the 10 dollars on the qdslrdashboard ios app, but it finally worked.

So far, I barely know how to work it, but I was able to get it to take a
timelapse after fiddling with it for a bit.
