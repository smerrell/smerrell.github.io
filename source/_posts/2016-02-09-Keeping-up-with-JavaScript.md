I like JavaScript, I really do, but I just haven't been able to keep up with the
insane change that is going on in that world. Over the last several months at
work I've been building out a project that is mostly back end work. When I have
been able to do any sort of front end work, it has been in a desktop Windows
application using WPF.

While working on this application I started to realize I don't have my finger on
the pulse of the JavaScript world like I once had several years ago. Things have
changed since Node and NPM made it incredibly easy to write JavaScript on both
the server side and client side and to distribute that code. I'll be honest, I
got a little scared when I realized I just don't know what all the latest and
greatest changes in the world of JavaScript. What's going to happen if people
find out I don't know what the next great Flux framework is? Or that I don't
really know what all is going on with the next version of JavaScript? Is it
called ES7 or is it ES2016?

All of that got me pretty worried until a co-worker of mine dropped this
statement:

{% pullquote %}
It doesn't matter if you step away from JavaScript for a while. As soon as you
pick it back up, the next big thing will have come out just yesterday anyway.
{% endpullquote %}

I still think it is silly how much things are changing and how much churn is
happening, but I can take comfort in one thing. Everyone else will basically be
working on the next new awesome JavaScript thing for as long as I have.
