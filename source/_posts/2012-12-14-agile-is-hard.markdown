Agile. Such a broad topic with so much to discuss. So how am I going to put my spin on things? Well, I'm not I'm just going to talk about what I've learned so far in over a year of really trying to do agile the right way.

# Scrum-de-dum

A little over a year ago we decided at work that the way we were doing things could really use some improvement. We were using Agile Zen and its online Kanban board but basically we were working in a waterfall manner. At the time we decided that we really needed to focus on making ourselves agile and decided to start out with Scrum.

# Two weeks

Talk about how things are going for us doing agile. It seems to be working pretty well and our early successes. How we really improved stakeholder contribution and involvement and how they were happy with it.

# Then things got hard

Over time we started falling into the trailer hitched qa (link to jeremy's post) and claiming "dev complete".

# Round two

Going to give a more Kanban style approach from now and see how that works out for us.
