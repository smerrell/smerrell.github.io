      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never paid much attention to podcasts. Up until a few months ago I was commuting to work by train and used that time to either read books, or play games. All of that has been great and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the time I have had to read, relax, or learn something new. Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve had to begin commuting to work which completely threw the routine I had developed.
Since I can&amp;rsquo;t really read or play games commuting, I had to find another alternative.</description>
