      <description>I like JavaScript, I really do, but I just haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to keep up with the insane change that is going on in that world. Over the last several months at work I&amp;rsquo;ve been building out a project that is mostly back end work. When I have been able to do any sort of front end work, it has been in a desktop Windows application using WPF.
While working on this application I started to realize I don&amp;rsquo;t have my finger on the pulse of the JavaScript world like I once had several years ago.</description>
