      <description>How much tedious work is involved in setting up and developing individual projects at your work? In my first post I wrote about how much tedious work is involved in setting up a new machine, now let&amp;rsquo;s dig a little deeper to the project level.
Automation at the project level is very much in line with Zach Holman&amp;rsquo;s talk on automating machine setup. In his talk he mentions that each project has it&amp;rsquo;s own setup scripts to get things up and running quickly.</description>

      <description>How well automated is your machine setup process? After watching Zach Holman&amp;rsquo;s excellent video Unsucking Your Teams Development Environment I got to thinking about the setup process we have at Extend Health (who is hiring, come work with us!). While we&amp;rsquo;ve always talked about smoothing out the process of setting up a new machine, we&amp;rsquo;ve never actually gotten around to it. That is, until now.
For GitHub, they use what they call The Setup which is a Ruby script that uses Puppet to manage all their machines.</description>
