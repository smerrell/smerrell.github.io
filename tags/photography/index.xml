      <description>Most of my posts are going to be something technology related but I do happen to have other interests. For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a Sony a6000 that I&amp;rsquo;ve been very happy with. I&amp;rsquo;m very much an amateur at photography but I find it fun and I like the images I get of my family more than the ones I can get from my iPhone. So I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly trying to level up my photography skills.</description>
