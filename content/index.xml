      <description>I started reading the book App Development with Swift a few weeks ago to teach myself Swift. For the last several years I&amp;rsquo;ve primarily been a backend developer using C# where I occasionally do work on the frontend with JavaScript. I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled in learning Rust as well but I wanted to try my hand at writing native macOS applications.
What about Xamarin I enjoy learning new things and since I use C# daily at work, I wanted to give native app development a chance.</description>
